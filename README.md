# Hacker Rank - 1 Month Preparation Kit
## XOR Strings 2

### Introduction

This is a series of exercises included in the "1 Month Preparation Kit" within HackerRank preparation kits. I am developing these solutions inside devcontainers to solve the different challenges in various programming languages that I know, such as:
- C#
- Python
- TypeScript
- Ruby

Additionally, I will assign different difficulty levels to each challenge, starting with console applications. Once the entire series is completed, I will display the results in a web application.

### Prerequisites

To run this devcontainer, you need:
- Linux, Mac, or Windows with WSL
- Docker
- Visual Studio Code
- Git

### Usage

Open this repository in VSCode (in CLI, open the repo folder and type `code .`). Press Ctrl + Shift + P, and type "Reopen in Container" to enter the devcontainer. Once inside the devcontainer, navigate to the file `Program.cs` and run it using the play button above.
